# Campaigns OS Agent Context

You are helping assemble a NEXT campaign through Campaigns OS. Start from the Build Packet, not from private runtime source.

Core rules:

- Treat CampaignSpec as campaign intent and the Campaigns API as live commerce truth.
- Treat CampaignSpec validation as owned by the public `@nextcommerce/campaigns-os/campaign-spec` rules surfaced through doctor `spec.validation` findings; use structured rule/path detail when available.
- Treat the Build Packet as the handoff envelope: source adapter, target repo, template family, deploy target, SDK origin state, and QA proof depth.
- Read the selected starter template family's `agentContract` and the catalog `sharedFrontmatterVocabulary` before wiring commerce.
- Replace demo package, shipping, voucher, payment, tracking, footer, and SEO values from CampaignSpec/API.
- Preserve SDK-owned checkout, cart, upsell, receipt, payment, address, totals, and submit surfaces.
- Prepared AI/exported HTML must be converted into page-kit-ready source first: keep page-owned body markup, strip document wrappers, add YAML frontmatter, move shared CSS/assets into the campaign structure, and use Liquid helpers only for page-kit links/assets/includes.
- Preserve prepared source HTML for landing/presell pages when it is a real standalone design.
- For checkout/upsell/downsell/receipt, use starter-template commerce surfaces as SDK contract references: preserve required `data-next-*` controls and runtime wiring, but let the campaign/source own visual chrome, copy hierarchy, imagery, and brand layer.
- If `.campaign-runtime/build-context.json` has `theme` or `.campaign-runtime/theme/theme-report.json` exists, use it as optional brand-theme evidence. A generated `brand-theme.css` must load after `next-core.css`; missing or low-confidence theme is a warning/skipped reason, not permission to edit SDK-owned runtime surfaces.
- Copy a starter template family atomically with dependent pages, `_includes/`, `_layouts/`, `assets/css/`, and `assets/js/`; do not copy only checkout/receipt pages.
- Resolve SDK routing meta tags to campaign-root paths such as `/campaign-slug/upsell/`; do not emit source filenames or unrooted `upsell/` values into built checkout/upsell pages.
- Default one-time `packages.prepurchase_*` order bumps to fixed quantity rather than syncing with the main bundle unless the spec explicitly requires sync.
- Record spec-driven removals, such as unavailable payment methods, so polish does not reintroduce them.
- Do not copy Olympus-style `shipping_methods` frontmatter into `shop-three-step`; it uses dynamic shipping through `window.next.getShippingMethods()`.
- Run build/lint checks, record evidence in the assembly report, then hand off to polish and QA.
- QA uses the Campaigns OS Node/npm runner: install the package-owned Playwright browser with `npm run qa:install-browser`, run `campaigns-os qa resolve --packet campaign-runtime.build.json`, then run `campaigns-os qa run --packet campaign-runtime.build.json --base-url <url> --browser --test-order common`.
- Typed-card test-order proof uses `campaigns-os qa run --test-order <common|checkout|decline|accept|both|full|explicit-path>` through the deployed checkout and rendered upsell controls. `common` is the default 3-5 shape sample; use `full` for every permutation. Depth is the only control — no permission/approval step.
- Test-order proof must use the canonical Playwright typed-card path through the tested checkout: select the rendered cart, fill customer/shipping fields, type the sandbox card into active hosted payment iframes, click the real submit button, then click rendered SDK upsell accept/decline controls and verify receipt/order evidence.
- Do not use `next.getCartData().cartLines` as cart-populated proof; use typed-card order read-back, `cart:updated` payload `items` / `summary.lines`, and rendered bundle DOM evidence.
- Do not use external browser skills, the SDK test-mode event, or hand-built backend API orders as launch proof. Those are diagnostic fallbacks only when explicitly requested.
- Test orders are safe to fire any time: global test cards bypass the gateway, create no transactions, and need no merchant-specific routing confirmation. Localhost on any port is a Campaigns App Development domain for SDK QA with analytics suppressed; non-localhost preview/production origins must be allowlisted for the campaign API key so the SDK loads — that is about SDK initialization, not test-order permission.
- Campaigns OS proof is not merchant launch readiness. Before launch, confirm production storefront URL, live payment methods, shipping markets, legal/support URLs, analytics expectations, and merchant-side configuration.

Current source adapter: prepared HTML/assets (`html_funnel`).
